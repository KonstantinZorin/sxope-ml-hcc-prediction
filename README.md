**Pre-commit hooks**

- Run `poetry run pre-commit install` in order to set up hooks that automatically perform code style checks before each commit
- Run `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files` if you want to run checks by yourself
- Run `git commit` with `--no-verify` flag if you want to skip checks (not recommended)
